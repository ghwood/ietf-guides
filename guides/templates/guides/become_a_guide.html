<h1>Become a Guide</h1>
  <p>Thanks for your interest in being an IETF Guide! Please provide the email address you would like to use. We will send you a link to a page where you can provide details, and maintain those details later.</p>
  <p>If you are already registered as a guide, but don't remember the link that was sent to you previously, it's safe to just provide your email address here again to cause the link to be resent.</p>
